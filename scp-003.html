                to come into contact with SCP-003.

                In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must
                engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to
                above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003

                stage.

                Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV

                reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately.
                SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-wide">Description</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify">SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.

                SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biology, arranged in a
                configuration similar to that of a computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest
                known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is considered sentient but not
                actively dangerous except under certain conditions.

                SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2
                are not part of any known language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.

                SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the contents of which are mostly
                inaccessible without risk of damaging SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of
                radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types. SCP-003-2 contains an internal power
                source of an anomalous nature, which appears to have been losing power since several centuries before
                discovery.

                It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of containing SCP-003-1. Partially
                interpreted data recovered from SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class
                restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.

                SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears possible that SRV-04 Beta was
                deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence,
                possibly by similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be sentient, based on its
                lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and procedures.

                When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35°C, both components react.

                First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential increase in mass. This growth
                state consists of two stages. In both stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter
                around it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including atmospheric elements, then
                nonliving organic material, including cells of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other
                biological materials.

                The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its mass, then take a form similar in
                shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star) of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a
                central processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that appear to scan its
                surrounding environment, and will partially convert the area around it to an unidentified anomalous
                substance (SCP-003-2 seems immune from conversion).

                The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003 comes into contact with living
                organic material; SCP-003 appears to "template" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt
                communication with organisms that match its initial "template" or "templates".

                In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and will also convert inorganic and
                nonliving organic elements into functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their
                physical makeup.

                While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage SCP-003-1's growth rate is diminished
                by 20-90% so long as SCP-003-1 remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is
                determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1 appears to devote a
                large amount of processing power to analysis of living organic material.

                During each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of radiation that temporarily
                inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, or reverse this growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above 100°C.
                Similar radiation emissions have been replicated or recorded via other anomalous means.

                SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant elements have been identified
                similar to SCP-███, SCP-1512, and SCP-2756, the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection
                with SCP-003-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of which are fully understood
                (technically, even less understood than SCP-003, thanks to the extensive cross-disciplinary research on
                the SCP-003 objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward which satisfactorily explains
                SCP-003-1's connection to these SCP objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond
                appearance (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism).</p>

            <p class="w3-justify"><mark><em>Acting on information gathered from linguistic analysis of SCP-003-2's runes and comparative data
                analysis, Research Team M03-Gloria has managed to establish a link between SCP-003 and [DATA EXPUNGED]
                for analysis of functions. SCP-003-1 must now be considered sentient, and is to be kept a minimum of 1
                km from [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting "by-product" at all times.</em></mark></p>

                O5-10, M03-Gloria will continue procedures.</em></mark></p>

            <h2 class="w3-wide">Addendum 003-03:</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify"><mark><em>During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth. Temperature
                was immediately returned to 100°C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6
                seconds, at which time a sustained radiation spike was produced by SCP-003-2. In response, SCP-003-1
                returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved into a dusty residue
                which was collected for analysis. Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2 ceased all detectable activity. SCP-003-2
                did not resume activity until connected to external power source. SCP-003-2's runes glowed uniformly
                gray and did not resume normal activity for three (3) hours. SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to
                maintain containment area at a temperature above 35°C without external power supplied by Generators
                003-III through IX.</em></mark></p>

            <h2 class="w3-wide">Addendum 003-04:</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify"><mark>><em>The procedure detailed in Addendum 003-03 was repeated, and SCP-003-1 again entered a growth state. After
                10 minutes and 13 seconds, SCP-003-2 once again produced a sustained radiation spike. SCP-003-1's growth
                stopped for 36 seconds, then resumed at its previous pace.

                On quadrupling its mass, SCP-003-1 formed a coherent outer shell and body. After appearing to scan its
                environment and partially converting its environment, SCP-003-1 then breached containment, entering the
                observation gallery where nine members of M03-Gloria were present. On physical contact with team
                members, SCP-003-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown appendages and stopped growth for 15 minutes.
                SCP-003-1 then resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the center of its form to the shape
                of a three-meter-tall female humanoid, with peripheral "tentacles" shifting to extrude primarily from
                SCP-003-1's newly formed "hair" and spine. SCP-003-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an
                apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers. [DATA EXPUNGED]

                An unknown individual approached the compromised containment area in company of a full squad of agents.
                The individual claimed to be acting on orders of O5-10 and attempted communication with SCP-003-1. [DATA
                EXPUNGED]

                Following this incident, Agent Jackson of M03-Gloria successfully restored power to SCP-003-2 and
                activated backup generators to return the temperature to 100°C. SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state
                in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and was successfully re-contained without incident.

                All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by SCP-003-1 were afterwards found to be physically unharmed,
                with no residual effects besides psychological trauma. The converted materials of SCP-003's former
                containment area did not dissolve and are now under analysis.</em></mark></p>
